11. Business intelligence developer: An engineer who is in charge of developing, deploying, and maintaining BI interfaces.

12. Business intelligence initiative: The goal of organizations to improve their revenue, operational efficiency, and competitive edge with better business decisions.

13. Business intelligence manager: A professional who uses data analysis to suggest and execute decisions for a company.

14. Business intelligence platform: A cluster of tools and applications that enables organizations to analyze data and get the insights to make decisions.

15. Business intelligence strategies: The blueprint that a company generates to use the data.

16. Business intelligence tools: Proprietary or open-source application software that is used to collect, process, analyze, sort, filter, and report large data from the systems and transform raw data into useful information.

17. Corporate performance management (CPM): A software that integrates information from various sources to support operational plans and align key performance indicators or KPIs to improve financial planning.

18. Customer relationship management (CRM) software: Software that helps companies measure and control their lead generation and sales pipelines.

19. Data analysis: A process that involves cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the aim of uncovering useful information to aid business decision-making. 

20. Data analyst: A data professional who first gathers and understands the data, then analyzes and interprets it before visualizing it and, finally, weaving it into a story.

21. Data analytics: A process that focuses on extracting valuable information from data using various tools, techniques, processes, and algorithms. It includes data analysis and the interpretation of the results, keeping in mind specific business objectives.

22. Data engineer: A professional responsible for building robust data architecture and easily accessible data warehouses. They also design, construct, and evaluate scalable big data environments to support businesses with the key objective of providing stable and highly optimized data pipelines and systems.

23. Data governance analyst: A data professional who helps a business ensure that its data is accurate, consistent, and compliant with legal and regulatory requirements. They also plan and execute security measures to protect and preserve computer databases.

24. Data integration: A combination of technical and business processes that combine data from disparate sources into meaningful and valuable information.

25. Data marts: A partition to manage one specific business function, department, or subject area in data warehouses. They are also called subsets. Data marts make specific data available to a defined group of users, which allows those users to quickly access critical insights without wasting time searching through an entire data warehouse.

26. Data mining: The process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets.

27. Data modeling: The process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures.

28. Data modeling tool:  Software applications that help you to design, create, and manage data models.

29. Data repositories: Also termed a data archive or library, it refers to a data set identified to be mined for reporting and analysis.

30. Data science: Process that focuses on understanding the data. This involves data analysis, beginning with data loading, exploring, and cleaning. It creatively explores data, coming up with new solutions and inventions.

31. Data scientist: A data professional who develops algorithms, builds predictive models, and uncovers patterns and trends in large data sets. They apply statistical analysis, especially inferential statistics, machine learning, and predictive modeling, to extract insights from data and make predictions.

32. Data storytelling: Skill that involves analyzing data to communicate insights and influence decisions.

33. Data visualization: The graphical representation of information and data. It helps data visualization to understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

34. Data warehouse: A warehouse that pulls together data from many different sources into a single data repository for sophisticated analytics and decision support.

35. Descriptive analysis:  The process of utilizing statistical techniques to explain or summarize a specific set of data. Descriptive analysis is also called descriptive statistics.

36. E-commerce: A platform for buying and selling products and services and transmitting funds and data over the internet.

37. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems: Software systems that enable businesses to automate and efficiently manage their key business processes to gain optimal performance.

38. Extract, load, transform (ETL) process: A process that extracts, loads, and transforms data from multiple sources to a data warehouse or other unified data repository.

39. Flat files: A collection of data that is stored specifically in a two-dimensional database. It usually contains a series of records (or lines), where each record is usually a sequence of fields.IBM InfoSphere DataStageETL tool and part of the IBM Information Platforms Solutions suite and IBM InfoSphere. It uses a graphical notation to construct data integration solutions.JavaScriptA high-level scripting or programming language that empowers the implementation of complex and sophisticated functionalities on web pages.

40. Key performance indicators (KPI): Performance measures for specific objectives that provide targets, milestones, and insights to help teams and individuals make better decisions.Machine learning engineersProgrammers who construct the algorithms, systems, models, and frameworks that enable machines to learn and perform functions independently and effectively.

41. Online analytical processing (OLAP): Software that is used to conduct multidimensional analysis on large volumes of data from a data warehouse, data mart, or other centralized data store.PythonAn agile, dynamically typed, expressive, open-source programming language that supports multiple programming philosophies, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional.
